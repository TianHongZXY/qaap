{"prompt_text": "Solve a question answering task by first parsing the question, figuring out what the question is asking, representing the query as a python dictionary with the key where the answer should be stored specified as either the subject or object, with the initial value of None. Secondly, decide what entities to search to find the answer. Thirdly, generate a background document that contains information relevant to the question being asked. Then read the generated document and the searched passage, step by step extract the information that directly and explicitly relates to the question, place the answer as the value of the answer key in the dictionary. For example, 'XXX joined A team in 2017, ..., in 2019, B team signed a contract with XXX', it is easy to know that B team and A team are mutually exclusive, therefore the termination time of A team is in 2019. Represent the extracted information as a dictionary and adding it to a list. If the context does not tell any useful information, extract nothing.\nHere are some examples.\nQuestion:what award did sylvia chang win in 1986?\nQuestion parsing:\n```python\nquery = {\"subject\": \"Sylvia Chang\", \"relation\": \"win award\", \"object\": None, \"time\": {\"start\": datetime(1986, 1, 1), \"end\": datetime(1986, 12, 31)}}\nanswer_key = \"object\"\n```\nSearch:\n```python\nentities_to_search = [\"Sylvia Chang\"]\n```\nGenerate a background document from Wikipedia to answer the given question: Sylvia Chang is a Taiwanese actress, writer, singer, producer and director.
